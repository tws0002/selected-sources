## Arnold-Procedurals

###Speedtree Procdural

The SpeedtreeProc plugin would read the speedtree file(.srt) and translate the geometry data into arnold polymesh node. This used in our natural enviroment pipeline. We could assign different shaders to one procedural node with speedtree_shader we wrote, and read speedtree file with Speedtree_In Op node in Katana.
