## Katana-SuperTools

### ArnoldLightGafferPackage

The ArnoldLightGafferPackage is a GafferThree Supertools that contents all presets of lights and light filters we could create them easily.

### MaterialXBake

The MaterialXBake tools is a Katana Supertools node, since Arnold support MaterialX but didn\`t provide any tools to export MaterialX file so I create Katana version MaterialXBake node to export shading networks from Katana, get ready to replace KLF(Katana look file) file in our pipeline in some special shots.
